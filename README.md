## Activity Description

### Objective
Create a contact book web application, which allows a user to see and search through all contacts, add new contacts, and edit and delete existing contacts.


### Requirements
- [X] On the contact book's start view, contacts should be displayed alphabetically by the last name.
- [X] The site should allow a user to filter contacts by their first and last name.
- [X] Clicking on a contact's name should display the contact's details view. The view should display all the information about the contact.
- [X] A new contact form should be available. The form should include, but not limited to, a first name, a last name, and an email. Submitting the form should create a new contact in the web application and to local storage. When the operation is complete, the application should display the contact's details view.
- [X] An edit contact form should be available. Submitting the form should update a contact in the web application and in local storage. When the operation is complete, the application should display the contact's details view.
- [X] A delete contact button should be available. Clicking the button should remove the contact in the web application and in local storage. When the operation is complete, the application should display the contact book's start view.
